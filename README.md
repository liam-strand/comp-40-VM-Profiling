# VM Profiling

This repository contains symbolic links to two submodules.

- [`./VM`](./VM/um-code) contains the initial implementation of the virtual machine, along with a [regression testing framework](./VM/um-code/testing).
- [`./profiling`](./profiling/submission/) contains the profiled and optimized version. Statistics and modifications are visible in the [notes](./profiling/submission/labnotes.pdf) document.

Unfortunately the code can not be kept in a public repository due to accademic integrity concerns, so these two submodules are private. If you would like to examine any of the above code or see the documentation, please reach out via [email](mailto:strandliam@gmail.com), Github [issue](https://github.com/liam-strand/comp-40-VM-Profiling/issues/new/choose), or carrier pigeon!

You can see a demo of this work [here](https://youtu.be/OnzkSmFvxiM)!

Best,\
Liam
