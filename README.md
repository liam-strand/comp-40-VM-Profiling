# VM Profiling

This repository contains symbolic links to two submodules.

- [`./VM`](https://github.com/liam-strand/hw6-um) contains the initial implementation of the virtual machine, along with a [regression testing framework](https://github.com/liam-strand/hw6-um/tree/master/um-code/testing).
- [`./profiling`](https://github.com/liam-strand/hw7-profiling/tree/master/submission) contains the profiled and optimized version. Statistics and modifications are visible in the [notes](https://github.com/liam-strand/hw7-profiling/tree/master/submission/labnotes.pdf) document.

You can see a demo of this work [here](https://youtu.be/OnzkSmFvxiM)!

Best,\
Liam
